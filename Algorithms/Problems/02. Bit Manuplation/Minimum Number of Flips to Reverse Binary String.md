## Minimum Number of Flips to Reverse Binary String
You are given a positive integer n.

Let s be the binary representation of n without leading zeros.

The reverse of a binary string s is obtained by writing the characters of s in the opposite order.

You may flip any bit in s (change 0 → 1 or 1 → 0). Each flip affects exactly one bit.

Return the minimum number of flips required to make s equal to the reverse of its original form.



Example 1:

Input: n = 7

Output: 0

Explanation:

The binary representation of 7 is "111". Its reverse is also "111", which is the same. Hence, no flips are needed.

Example 2:

Input: n = 10

Output: 4

Explanation:

The binary representation of 10 is "1010". Its reverse is "0101". All four bits must be flipped to make them equal. Thus, the minimum number of flips required is 4.



Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109


```csharp
 public static int MinimumFlips(int n) {
        // Step 1: Get binary representation without leading zeros
        string binary = Convert.ToString(n, 2);

        int flips = 0;
        int len = binary.Length;

        // Step 2: Compare each bit with its corresponding bit in the reverse
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (binary[i] != binary[len - 1 - i]) {
                flips++;
            }
        }

        // Each flip is counted once, but we need to flip each differing bit
        // So flips is exactly the number of differing positions
        return flips;
    }
```
